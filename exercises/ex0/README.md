# Getting Started

This hands-on exercise focuses on two tools used by customers for planning and executing the conversion or upgrade to SAP S/4HANA targets. These are:

<li> Maintenance Planner
<li> Data Transition Validation

As a part of this hands-on session, you will learn how to plan for a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA using the maintenance planner. You will see the results of the Add-ons and Business Functions check performed by the tool. Additionally, you will generate the stack XML which is used by Software Update Manager to actually execute the system conversion.

While the execution of the Software Update Manager is not a part of this hands-on session, the focus topic of this session is the Data Transition Validation(DTV) tool. In the DTV tool, you will experience how validation project can be identified and configured to validate business data before and after system conversion. This helps the business consultants / customers to validate the quality of the converted data during system conversion or 
SAP S/4HANA Updates or upgrades. The aim is to assist the validation process during the business downtime by automating the validation and reducing manual activities.

Finally, as an optional exercise, you will have the possibility to see how the SAP Notes recommendation feature works in the maintenance planner. It enables you to identify critical SAP notes which are to be implemented in the SAP S/4HANA systems.

Now that you have understood the big picture of the session, you may continue to - [Exercise 1 - Generating a stack XML using Maintenance Planner](../ex1/README.md)
