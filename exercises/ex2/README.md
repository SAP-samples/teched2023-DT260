# Exercise 2 - Validate your business data using Data Transition Validation tool

## Before you start

The data transition validation is a tool that allows you to compare business data before and after a system conversion from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA. Additionally, you can perform validations during SAP S/4HANA system upgrade. Currently, the scope of the tool is to support validation of system conversion transition scenario or SAP S/4HANA upgrades. The tool uses business reports or transactions as instruments of comparison.

<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Pre-delivered%20content/image-11.png)


### Exercise 2.2.2 Maintain test specification
In this exercise, you will define the input parameters for each report. The input parameters are – Split, Conditions and Variant. These parameters will be considered for data extraction.

Configuration is already done for this exercise. Please check all the required tabs and save the configuration.

&#x1F4A1; Note: When a report is imported from pre-delivered content, the tool suggests certain split and conditions for each report. These parameters can be modified as per the scope.

1. Click on back button and double click on Define Test Specification
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-0.png)

> Input parameter: Split <br>
The split represents the granularity at which the data is extracted and compared. The granularity of each split is represented as Workitem and Workitem description specifies the value for it.
> <br> For Example: If the company is specified as split condition, then the results are extracted and compared at the granularity of company.
2. Double click on report name and go to split tab. 
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-1.png)

>Input parameter: Condition <br>
The conditions represent selection parameters which are to be passed for report execution to extract data. Multiple distinct conditions can be maintained for each system.
3. Go to Condition tab. Use the drop down to switch system and check the conditions for each system (ECC and S4).
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-2.png)

### Exercise 2.2.3 Maintain project global data
In the previous step, we maintained split parameters for each report. In this step, we will maintain the values for each split. The Project Global Data screen allows you to capture the data, which is common across all the test specifications. By doing so, you can avoid maintaining the same data several times, for example, company, profit center, cost center, and so on. Setting up the project global data is necessary.  You can use it to define the split conditions in the test specifications.

1. Click on back button and double click on Project Global Data

## Exercise 2.3 Perform Simulation (OPTIONAL)
<b>&#x1F4A1; Note : In the interest of time, it is recommended to skip this Exercise and proceed with Exercise 2.4 . You may revisit this section, once the other sections are completed. </b> <br>
In the following exercise you will learn how to simulate the execution of tests. Purpose of the simulation is to provide you the ability to check if the extraction of data is successful with the provided input. This is more relevant when one has to check for the memory and runtime requirements. Simulation results provide information about artifacts, such as:
<li>If the simulation was successful, then how many records were selected, and what is the memory size.
<li>If the simulation was unsuccessful, then the same is indicated by the status.
<li>In the Logs tab, the logs of the execution is shown. If the simulation is unsuccessful, the log provides appropriate message. 

<br>
