# Exercise 2 - Validate your business data using Data Transition Validation tool

## Before you start

The data transition validation is a tool that allows you to compare business data before and after a system conversion from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA. Additionally, you can perform validations during SAP S/4HANA system upgrade. Currently, the scope of the tool is to support validation of system conversion transition scenario or SAP S/4HANA upgrades. The tool uses business reports or transactions as instruments of comparison.
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Introduction/image-0.png)

In the hands-on session <hands on ID>, you will get to experience the processes involved in the business data validation using DTV tool during the ECC to SAP S/4HANA conversion.  You will get experience of creating a DTV project, Maintaining Test specification, data extraction in source and target and finally performing data evaluation and obtain the comparison results.  
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Introduction/image-1.png)

Login to your SAP TechEd system , and open the SAP Launchpad. Use the system named ECC Prior to conversion for the below activity of Project setup , Maintain systems , Import pre-delivered content, Maintain test specificaion and Souce Extraction.

## Exercise 2.2 Finalize and maintain test bed for validation

Maintain the tests for validation in your DTV project.

### Exercise 2.2.1 Maintain systems
In this exercise, systems are specified that shall participate in data validation. Usually, these systems are SAP ECC as source and SAP S/4HANA as target for conversion process. 
Note : For SAP S/4HANA upgrade process, the source is the current release and the target is the release that you want to upgrade to. </i>

1. Double click on step Maintain Sytems.

8. Click on save
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Maintain%20systems/image-7.png)


### Exercise 2.2.2 Import test from predelivered content
In the following exercise, you can use pre delivered reports to perform validation. Import these reports and the tool uses them to create the test specifications within the project of the selected business area. You can use these test specifications for analyzing and comparing the data during validation process.

1. Click on back button on maintain systems screen
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Pre-delivered%20content/image-8.png)

2. Double click on Pre Delivered Content
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Pre-delivered%20content/image-9.png)

3. Expand Financial Accounting in test specification column.
4. Go to Open Items/ Line Items->Reports and select RFDEPL00 report.
5. Go to General ->Reports and select RFBILA00 report.
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Pre-delivered%20content/image-10.png)

6.	Click on Import Specification and confirm.
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Pre-delivered%20content/image-11.png)


### Exercise 2.2.2 Maintain test specification
In this exercise, you will define the input parameters for each report. The input parameters are – Split, Conditions and Variant. These parameters will be considered for data extraction.

> Note: When a report is imported from test specification, the tool specifies certain split and conditions for each report. These parameters can be modified as per the scope.

1. Click on back button and double click on Define Test Specification
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-0.png)

> Input parameter: Split <br>
The split represents the granularity at which the data is extracted and compared. The granularity of each split is represented as Workitem and Workitem description specifies the value for it. If the company is specified as split condition, then the results are extracted and compared at the granularity of company.
2. Double click on report name and go to split tab. 
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-1.png)

>Input parameter: Condition <br>
The conditions represent se38 parameters which are passed with report execution to extract data. Multiple distinct conditions can be maintained for each system.
3. Go to Condition tab. Use the drop down to switch system and check the conditions for each system (ECC and S4).
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-2.png)

>Input parameter: Variant <br>
The variant represents the variant maintained for each report per system. For this project, no variant is maintained.
4. Go to variant tab.
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-3.png)

>Similarly, input parameters can be checked for RFDEPL00 report by double clicking on the report name

5. Click on save.
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Define%20test%20specification/image-4.png)


### Exercise 2.2.3 Maintain project global data
In the previous step, we maintained split parameters for each report. In this step, we will maintain the values for each split. The Project Global Data screen allows you to capture the data, which is common across all the test specifications. By doing so, you can avoid maintaining the same data several times, for example, company, profit center, cost center, and so on. Setting up the project global data is necessary. These are the data that is relevant for the entire project. You can use it to define the split conditions in the test specifications.

1. Click on back button and double click on Project Global Data
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Project%20global%20data/image-0.png)

2. Double Click on Company_Code to maintain company code values.

## Exercise 2.3 Perform Simulation (OPTIONAL)
In the following exercise you will learn how simulate the execution of tests. Purpose of the simulation is to provide you the ability to check if the extraction of data is successful with the provided input. This is more relevant to check for the memory and runtime requirements. Simulation results provide information about artifacts, such as:
<li>If the simulation was successful, then how many records were selected, and what is the memory size.
<li>If the simulation was unsuccessful, then the same is indicated by the status.
<li>In the Logs tab, the logs of the execution is shown. If the simulation is unsuccessful, the log provides appropriate message.


### Exercise 2.3.1 Execute simulation
1. Click on back button and double click on Define Test Specification step.
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Simulation/image-0.png)

2. Select both reports and click on Simulate button. (To select both reports, click on select all button on the alv) 
<br>![](/exercises/ex2/images/Simulation/image-1.png)

>Similarly, simulation data can be checked for RFDEPL00 report.


## Exercise 2.4 Extraction in Source system
In the following exercise you will learn how extract data in source system. The extraction screen provides a list of all the reports or transactions configured in the Define Test Specification screen. The data for such reports can be extracted from this screen. The reports are shown in a tree structure with the hierarchy as Business Area >  Business Group  Type  > Report Name > System names. Extraction of reports is performed only on the leaf nodes, which are on the nodes where System IDs are present.

### Exercise 2.4.1 Execute extraction
