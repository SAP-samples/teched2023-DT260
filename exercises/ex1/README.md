   On selecting the same, the current SAP ERP product version present on the system shows up in the "Current Version" field. Make the selections as shown in the screenshot below for "Target Version", "Target Stack". The "Target Product Instances" will be pre-selected.

   <br>![Target selections](/exercises/ex1/images/mp_004.png)</i>

   Below is a small description of the fields:

   1. <i>Target Version</i>: The target SAP S/4HANA version
   2. <i>Target Stack</i>: The Feature Package Stack or Support Package Stack of the target version.
   3. <i>Target Product Instances</i>: Core and additional business functionality of the target stack you want to include in the SAP S/4HANA system.

   Keep the selections as is, and click on "Next".

4. <b> Additional Systems </b>

   In this step, one can select the Frontend server for deploying the SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA software, and the Java adapters for SAP S/4HANA.

   SAP Fiori can be deployed in your system landscape on an existing frontend server, new frontend server, or together with SAP S/4HANA backend. These options are provided by maintenance planner as shown in the screenshot below.

5. <b> Summary </b>

   In this step, you can see the results of the Add-ons and business functions for SAP S/4HANA system conversion planning. The results summarize the following in general:

   - SAP add-ons in the system which are incompatible with the target SAP S/4HANA version (including the ones which can be uninstalled during conversion).
   - Third party add-ons which need to be checked up with the vendor about their compatibility with target SAP S/4HANA version.
   - Activated Business Functions compatibility against the target SAP S/4HANA version
   - Software-component-versions which are not assigned to any SAP product-versions as per the SAP product model.
   - Links to related documentation.

   Once you have gone through the details in this step, click on "Continue Planning" to move to the next guided procedure used for generating the stack XML.

2. <b> Select Files: Select OS/DB dependent files </b>

   In this step, you can select additional software required for the conversion. This includes:

   - SAP Kernel and related components like SAP IGS.
   - Software Logistic tools like Software Update Manager
   - SAP Host Agent
   - SAP HANA Database and Client revision

   Click on the expand arrow to see the list of selectable software.

3. <b> Select Files: Select Stack Dependent and Independent files </b>

   This step is meant to present the list of all the calculated delta packages which are required by Software Logistic tools to implement. This delta includes:

   - Add-on installation packages, if there are any for the planned target.
   - Support-Packages of the selected target.
   - Add-on exchange upgrade packages, if there are any relevant for the target.
   - Attribute Change Packages (ACPs), if there are any required for this plan.
   - Files for non-ABAP components like SAP Kernel, SAP IGS, Software Logistic tools, SAP Kernel hotfix patches like R3Trans.
   - Installation or Upgrade archives (including languages) for SAP S/4HANA product versions.

   You may explore these in this step by collapsing/expanding the relevant tree nodes.
